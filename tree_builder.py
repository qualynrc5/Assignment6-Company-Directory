--- Design Memo ---
How did recursive insertion work?
Recursive insertion worked by checking each node repeatedly until the correct manager was found, then attaching the new employee as left or right child. The process begins 
at the root which is the team lead and moves downward. If current node matches manager, the new employee is placed in chosen side. If not, the function searches left and 
right subtrees unti manager is located. Eliminating a need for loops. 

What challenges did you face when finding the right spot for a new employee? I struggled with testing my code. At first, when I inserted a team lead, a manager, and a new employee, only the manager would appear in the output.
After re-reading how the team structure should be organized and what the printed result was supposed to look like, I was able to adjust my code and get it working correctly. 
Understanding how to manage these edge cases and make sure the recursive calls returned control at the right time took some experimenting. It was also tricky to prevent 
overwriting an existing left or right employee, but once I figured out how the recursive insertion worked, everything started to make more sense.

When might trees be preferable to other data structures in real-world systems?
Trees are useful when we need to show relationships that have different levels, like a company‚Äôs management structure, folders in a computer, or an organizational chart.
They make it easier to add, find, and display information in a way that shows who reports to whom or how items are grouped. Unlike lists or arrays, which store data in a
straight line, trees show connections between items in a branching structure. This makes them a good choice when one piece of data depends on or is connected to another.
